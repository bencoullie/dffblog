        Solo work
      %p Durban From Far is currently comprised of me alone - Ben Coullie (23). I started the project to practice and improve on soundtrack-inspired composition and that's just what I'll do.
      %p I collect soundtracks; from obscure indie games to hollywood films I've been slowly amassing my own personal library which (as well as giving me feels) provides a massive chunk of my inspiration.
      %p In late 2013 I moved from Durban, South Africa to Auckland , New Zealand (LOTR awww yus).
      %p Ultimately I want to compose soundtracks. Sounds clichÃ©, but I don't care about being paid for it.

      %p.other
        90% of what I do is via a DAW (digital audio workstation).
        %a.linkstyle{:href => "http://www.renoise.com"} Renoise
        is the one I use most often.
      %p.other Ideally I would have people play the instruments but, as orchestras are hard to come by, I make do with digital sounds.
      %p.other Although I'm still learning myself, I'll be more than happy to help anyone wanting to understand the basics. Just email me!
      %h4.lightf.margintoptwenty.tac Instrumental
      %p.other I love to play around with different instruments and figure out ways of including them in my music.
      %p.other I primarily play ukulele but I also dabble in guitar, piano and pretty much anything else I can get my hands on.
      %p.other I plan to incorporate more instrumental stuff as I get better (don't hold your breath).
